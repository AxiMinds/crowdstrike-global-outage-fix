## Introduction

This guide presents a comprehensive, three-prong approach to recovering large numbers of computers affected by critical issues, such as problematic driver files. The solution is designed to be scalable, secure, and adaptable to various organizational needs and technical environments.

## Prong 1: Fully Automated Network-Based Solution

### Setup

1. **PXE Server Configuration**:
   - Set up a PXE server using Windows Deployment Services (WDS) or a third-party solution.
   - Create a custom Windows PE image with integrated recovery scripts.

2. **Central Management Server**:
   - Develop a management application to orchestrate the recovery process.
   - Implement a secure database to store BitLocker recovery keys and machine statuses.

3. **Custom Windows PE Image**:
   - Include PowerShell and necessary networking components.
   - Embed the main recovery script and reporting mechanisms.

### Main Recovery Script

```powershell
# Main recovery script for automated network-based solution

# Import necessary modules
Import-Module BitLocker
Import-Module Microsoft.PowerShell.Security

# Function to securely retrieve BitLocker recovery key from central server
function Get-BitLockerKey {
    param($computerName)
    $apiUrl = "https://centralserver.company.com/api/bitlocker-key"
    $headers = @{
        "Authorization" = "Bearer $env:API_TOKEN"
        "Content-Type" = "application/json"
    }
    $body = @{
        "computerName" = $computerName
    } | ConvertTo-Json

    try {
        $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $apiUrl -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body
        return $response.bitlockerKey
    }
    catch {
        throw "Failed to retrieve BitLocker key: $_"
    }
}

# Function to securely report status back to central server
function Report-Status {
    param($computerName, $status, $errorMessage)
    $apiUrl = "https://centralserver.company.com/api/report-status"
    $headers = @{
        "Authorization" = "Bearer $env:API_TOKEN"
        "Content-Type" = "application/json"
    }
    $body = @{
        "computerName" = $computerName
        "status" = $status
        "errorMessage" = $errorMessage
    } | ConvertTo-Json

    try {
        Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $apiUrl -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error "Failed to report status: $_"
    }
}

# Function to log messages with timestamp
function Log-Message {
    param($message)
    $timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
    Add-Content -Path "X:\RecoveryLogs\recovery.log" -Value "$timestamp - $message"
    Write-Host $message
}

# Function to perform recovery steps
function Perform-Recovery {
    param($computerName)
    
    try {
        Log-Message "Starting recovery process for $computerName"

        # Retrieve BitLocker key
        $bitlockerKey = Get-BitLockerKey -computerName $computerName
        Log-Message "BitLocker key retrieved successfully"

        # Unlock BitLocker
        $volume = Get-BitLockerVolume -MountPoint "C:"
        Unlock-BitLocker -MountPoint "C:" -RecoveryPassword $bitlockerKey
        Log-Message "BitLocker unlocked successfully"

        # Create backup
        $backupPath = "X:\Backup\$computerName"
        New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $backupPath -Force
        Copy-Item -Path "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\Crowdstrike\C-00000291*.sys" -Destination $backupPath -Force
        Log-Message "Backup created at $backupPath"

        # Modify boot configuration for Safe Mode
        bcdedit /set {default} safeboot minimal
        Log-Message "Boot configuration modified for Safe Mode"

        # Restart into Safe Mode
        Log-Message "Restarting into Safe Mode"
        shutdown /r /t 0

        # Wait for restart and confirm Safe Mode
        Start-Sleep -Seconds 180
        if (-not (Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem).BootupState -eq "Safe Mode") {
            throw "Failed to boot into Safe Mode"
        }
        Log-Message "Successfully booted into Safe Mode"

        # Delete offending driver file
        Remove-Item -Path "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\Crowdstrike\C-00000291*.sys" -Force
        Log-Message "Offending driver file deleted"

        # Revert boot configuration
        bcdedit /deletevalue {default} safeboot
        Log-Message "Boot configuration reverted to normal"

        # Restart normally
        Log-Message "Restarting system normally"
        shutdown /r /t 0

        Report-Status -computerName $computerName -status "Success"
        Log-Message "Recovery process completed successfully"
    }
    catch {
        $errorMessage = $_.Exception.Message
        Log-Message "Error occurred: $errorMessage"
        Report-Status -computerName $computerName -status "Failed" -errorMessage $errorMessage
    }
}

# Main execution
$computerName = $env:COMPUTERNAME
Perform-Recovery -computerName $computerName
```

### Process

1. Central server initiates recovery for target machines (e.g., using Wake-on-LAN).
2. Machines boot into the custom PXE image.
3. Recovery script runs automatically, retrieving necessary info from the central server.
4. Script performs recovery steps, reporting progress back to the central server.
5. Central server monitors and logs the recovery process for all machines.

## Prong 2: IT Admin-Assisted Recovery

$form.Controls.Add($textboxBitLocker)

# Create buttons
$buttonUnlock = New-Object System.Windows.Forms.Button
$buttonUnlock.Location = New-Object System.Drawing.Point(10,70)
$buttonUnlock.Size = New-Object System.Drawing.Size(120,30)
$buttonUnlock.Text = "Unlock BitLocker"
$buttonUnlock.Add_Click({
    $bitlockerKey = $textboxBitLocker.Text
    try {
        Unlock-BitLocker -MountPoint "C:" -RecoveryPassword $bitlockerKey
        [System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox]::Show("BitLocker unlocked successfully", "Success")
    }
    catch {
        [System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox]::Show("Failed to unlock BitLocker: $_", "Error")
    }
})
$form.Controls.Add($buttonUnlock)

$buttonRecover = New-Object System.Windows.Forms.Button
$buttonRecover.Location = New-Object System.Drawing.Point(140,70)
$buttonRecover.Size = New-Object System.Drawing.Size(120,30)
$buttonRecover.Text = "Perform Recovery"
$buttonRecover.Add_Click({
    try {
        # Create backup
        $backupPath = "X:\Backup\$env:COMPUTERNAME"
        New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $backupPath -Force
        Copy-Item -Path "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\Crowdstrike\C-00000291*.sys" -Destination $backupPath -Force

        # Modify boot configuration for Safe Mode
        bcdedit /set {default} safeboot minimal

        # Prompt for restart
        $result = [System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox]::Show("System will restart into Safe Mode. Run this tool again after restart to complete recovery.", "Restart Required", [System.Windows.Forms.MessageBoxButtons]::OKCancel)
        if ($result -eq [System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult]::OK) {
            shutdown /r /t 0
        }
    }
    catch {
        [System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox]::Show("Error during recovery: $_", "Error")
    }
})
$form.Controls.Add($buttonRecover)

# Show form
$form.ShowDialog()
```

### Process

1. IT admin boots the affected computer using the prepared USB drive.
2. Admin runs the recovery application, which guides them through the process.
3. Application prompts for BitLocker key and performs necessary actions.
4. After reboot, admin runs the application again to complete the recovery.

## Prong 3: Alternative Manual Recovery Method

### Detailed Recovery Steps

1. **Boot into Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)**:
   - Force a hard shutdown by holding the power button.
   - Boot the computer and interrupt the boot process (e.g., F8 or Shift+Restart).
   - Choose Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Command Prompt.

2. **Perform Recovery Steps**:
   From the command prompt, execute these commands:

   ```cmd
   # Navigate to the Windows directory
   cd C:\Windows\System32

   # Create a backup directory
   mkdir C:\Backup
   
   # Backup the offending driver file
   copy drivers\Crowdstrike\C-00000291*.sys C:\Backup

   # Rename the offending driver file
   ren drivers\Crowdstrike\C-00000291*.sys C-00000291.old

   # Modify boot configuration for Safe Mode
   bcdedit /set {default} safeboot minimal

   # Restart the computer
   wpeutil reboot
   ```

3. **After the computer restarts in Safe Mode**:
   - Log in and open an elevated Command Prompt.
   - Run the following commands:

   ```cmd
   # Delete the renamed driver file
   del C:\Windows\System32\drivers\Crowdstrike\C-00000291.old

   # Revert boot configuration
   bcdedit /deletevalue {default} safeboot

   # Restart the computer
   shutdown /r /t 0
   ```

4. Verify that the system boots normally and the issue is resolved.
